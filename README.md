# Seattle-Airbnb-Data_set
Using Airbnb data for Seattle I was eager to find answers to the following questions:
1. What's the **busiest time** of the year? Are there any seasonal pattern in terms of visitors evident ?
2. What are the most popular **neighbourhoods** ? Did popularity change over time ?
3. Is the airbnb market dominated by professional  or amateur  renters ? What's the **revenue distrubution** between the top earners and the rest ?
