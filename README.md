## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. 
To run the geodata mapping code some special modules need to be installed:
- imageio 
- geopandas 
- shapely
- contextily

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Using Airbnb data for Seattle I was eager to find answers to the following questions:

1. What's the **busiest time** of the year? Are there any seasonal pattern in terms of visitors evident ?
2. What are the most popular **neighbourhoods** ? Did popularity change over time ?
3. Is the airbnb market dominated by professional  or amateur  renters ? What's the **revenue distrubution** between the top earners and the rest ?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 main notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is  exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

A third notebook includes additional code that was used to map geodata for Seattle and generate a interactive map. 
The respective output file `animation.mp4'file shows the final result.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@nassimo/what-can-we-learn-from-airbnb-about-seattle-4342b7626b52).
